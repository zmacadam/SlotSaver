# SlotSaver
An automation application that sends TCU students an SMS notification when a new reservation slot has opened up for our school recreation center.

SlotSaver uses Selenium running on a Java Spring Boot server to constantly refresh the reservation page to find when a new slot has opened up using CSS queries. User and reservation information is stored in a MySQL database.
